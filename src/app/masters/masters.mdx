## Abstract

The Dual Marching Tetrahedra algorithm is a generalization of the Dual Marching Cubes algorithm, used to build a boundary surface around points which have been assigned a particular scalar density value, such as the data produced by and Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography scanner. This boundary acts as a skin between points which are determined to be “inside” and “outside” of an object. However, the DMT is vague in regards to exactly where each vertex of the boundary should be placed, which will not necessarily produce smooth results. Mesh smoothing algorithms which ignore the DMT data structures may distort the output mesh so that it could incorrectly include or exclude density points. Thus, an algorithm is presented here which is designed to smooth the output mesh, while obeying the underlying data structures of the DMT algorithm.
